# Vux Experiment

Is it possible to have simple API for our react application similar to Vue.js with following characteristics?
- Component composability by default
- Single application state
- Unidirectional flow
- Functional-like actions (similar to Redux)
- Type friendly  

## Background
I went trhough many libraries to find what I am looking for. From big once redux, cycle.js, cerebral.js to dozen of smaller ones.

## Questions
- Have you seen similar API for react somewere else?
- What's wrong/bad on this approach (the implementation could be definitelly improved)?
- Is it possible to integrated it with another frameworks? Which one would be a godd fit?
